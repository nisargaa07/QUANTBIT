# QUANTBIT
This repository contains solutions to two assignments provided by Quantibit as part of an internship opportunity. The first task involves performing K-means clustering on the Iris dataset and applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction to visualize the clusters in a 2D space. The solution includes data preprocessing, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and visualization, along with the evaluation of clustering performance using the Adjusted Rand Index. The second task focuses on classifying images of handwritten digits (0â€“9) from the MNIST dataset using a neural network. The implementation includes data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and visualization of predictions. Both tasks demonstrate key skills in data analysis, machine learning, and visualization.
